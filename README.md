# Isosurfaces VTK data 

This project was done by using openFrameworks reading a VTK data 

# Part 1: 2D Slice Viewer

The application supports the user selecting any axis-aligned slice, which requires them to select either a 
plane x , y or z in the range of the dimensions of the data

the result looks like this 



# Part 2: 3D Contouring

An implementation of the original form of Marching Cubes by Lorensen and Cline. Marching cubes is an algorithm to extract an approximation of an isosurface â€“ the set of points f(^-1)(p) for a given isovalue p

the result looks like this
